# oaftl.bash
OpenAndFollowTheLine.bash - Uses "tail" and "grep" to search for one line that are repeating itself in a live text. Seems like this is done for now!


Needed the script once, why not make it better and share it open-source with the rest of the world? Well, here it is! My fastest wroten script yet, and it is actually fully working as it should. What can i say? I am a happy boy that ended up with actually enjoying playing with bash!

Oneliner installation script "wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godzillamesel/oaftl.bash/master/install.bash | bash"


Manually installation is easy, gonna explain later.
You have to:

sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godzillamesel/oaftl.bash/master/oaftl.bash

sudo cp oaftl.bash /usr/bin/oaftl
